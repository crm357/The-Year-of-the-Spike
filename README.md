#### The Year of the Spike.

2021 will be documented by proper historians as the "Year of the Spike".  The spike in question is the over 6000% increase in recorded deaths from the American vaccination program that occurred during calendar year 2021, according to the data in the FDA/CDC jointly-managed vaccine adverse effects reporting system known as VAERS (https://vaers.hhs.gov/).

The Cleveland Report is old. It was pulled together at the end of 2021 to see where the data of the COVID pandemic stood. It's largely a compendium of measurements from sources world-wide tracked during the COVID pandemic. Results were published from across the globe revealing a distinctive disconnect between the narratives from offical medical recommendations and positions regarding COVID vaccine safety and effectiveness, and actual observations in the field.

While the Cleveland Report is a bit dated, it's content comprises reproducible results lending credence that the official narrative pushed by both government health organizations, who should have known better, and a host of main-stream media outlets who actually didn't give a piss, and what was recorded over time simply didn't match.

The report is comprised of both data and graphs from various organizations and a deep dive into the VAERS dataset.  The VAERS analysis is by the author.
